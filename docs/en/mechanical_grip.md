6. Turn the servo gear to the end position.
7. Install the Phillips mount onto the gear.
8. Secure the Phillips mount using the screw supplied with the servo.
9. Tie the servo thread so that there is a 2 to 3 cm margin.
10. Thread the servo thread into the corresponding tensioning slots.
11. Fasten the grip claws with small self-tapping screws so that their angle is 25 ° –40 °.
12. Install the assembled grip onto the aircraft from below.
